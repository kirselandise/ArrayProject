Project Outline: 
Create 4 functions and 2 exceptions that read and edit a text file containing 100 integers

Instructions: 
1) Run the project
2) You will be shown the data. Then prompted how you would like to edit it. Enter one of the letters provided, respectively, as instructed. The methods are:
- Check: Checks if a value exists in the data and prints out its location
- Add: Adds a data entry
- Modify: Modify a data entry at a specific location
- Delete: Deletes a data entry to 0 or empty. 
3) Continue as instructed, using letters to communicate with the program. Simply type n when prompted to exit. 

Assumptions: 
- I have written the data into a 2d array, 10 by 10
- I assume 100 entrys (10 by 10) is the maximum amount of data allowed. As such, the array cannot store more than 100 entries
- Zero counts as an "empty" or "deleted" entry
- I assume that "checkEntry" only identifies the first instance of an entry, not any duplicates
- To make is easier for general users, rows and columns start at 1 instead of 0 when answering or prompting the user
- The exceptions for adding or modifying an entry identify whether or not the entry was an integer. I am assuming we do not need more exceptions than what was requested in the assignment
